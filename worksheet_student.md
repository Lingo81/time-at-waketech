# Relational Database Design Worksheet

---

## Instructions

1. **Read the scenario.**
2. **Identify at least 3 tables (entities)** that capture the major "things" in the scenario.
3. **List fields (columns) for each table** and select a primary key.
4. **Describe how your tables are related** (using foreign keys).
5. **Draw your database schema as an ERD** (Entity-Relationship Diagram), using the Mermaid format provided.
6. **Double-check** that every foreign key points to a primary key, and every table has a unique identifier.

## Scenario

*(Paste scenario here, e.g., Food Delivery App, Course Registration System, etc.)*

---

### Step 1: List Your Tables (Entities)

* Table 1: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Table 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Table 3: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* (Optional) Table 4: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Step 2: Define Fields and Primary Keys

For each table, list at least 3â€“5 fields. Mark your primary key with **(PK)**.

| Table Name | Field Name (Type) | Purpose/Description | PK? (Y/N) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
|            |                   |                     |           |
|            |                   |                     |           |
|            |                   |                     |           |

(Add extra rows as needed.)

---

### Step 3: Identify Relationships

* Table \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ relates to Table \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (describe the connection).
* Relationship type (circle one): One-to-One / One-to-Many / Many-to-Many
* Which field(s) are foreign keys? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

### Step 4: Draw Your ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

Paste your Mermaid code below.
(Make sure table names and field names match your list above!)

---

### Step 5: Quick Checklist

* [ ] Every table has a primary key.
* [ ] Foreign keys connect related tables.
* [ ] Relationships are clearly described.
* [ ] Diagram matches table/field names.
* [ ] No unnecessary repetition or duplicate data.
